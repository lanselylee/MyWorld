### Requirement: Homepage Hero Section Layout
- **Description:** Hero section elements should be horizontally and vertically centered across all screen sizes.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC002
- **Test Name:** Homepage Hero Section Centering
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC002_Homepage_Hero_Section_Centering.py)

They are not horizontally or vertically centered as requested. The page was not tested on tablet or mobile viewports, so responsive centering behavior is unknown. To fix this, CSS changes are needed to wrap these elements in a container using flexbox or grid with properties to center content both horizontally and vertically across all screen sizes. Task is not fully finished as responsive checks and fixes are pending.
